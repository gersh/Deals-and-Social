== Welcome to Deals and Social

This web application is built on top of twitter API. It allows a user to enter an interest
phrase/sentence, a location, and a radius; it then finds people with similar interest/need by
reading tweets published by people in the specified geographic range. The user then can send
a message to the group, maybe suggesting an action.

For example, on a beautiful day in Auguest, if a user comes to the application and types in 
"boat tour Chicago architecture", then specify "Chicago", 10 miles, s/he can find some people
expressing the same interest. S/he can then organize a group of 20 people to take a tour boat
and have a group discount. Of course, a user is free to organize any other spontaneous activity,
not necessarily involving a commercial transaction. The app is named as such because we were
too caught up in the daily deal fervor!
