== Welcome to Deals and Social

This web application was written during Chicago API Hackday in June 2011. It's built on
top of twitter API. A user enters an interest phrase/sentence, a location,
and a radius; then the app finds people with similar interest/need by reading tweets from
people in the specified geographic range. The user then can send
a message to the group, maybe suggesting an action/event.

For example, on a beautiful day in Auguest, if a user comes to the application and types in 
"boat tour Chicago architecture", then specify "Chicago", 10 miles, s/he can find some people
expressing the same interest. S/he can then organize a group of 20 people to take a tour boat
and have a group discount. Of course, a user is free to organize any other spontaneous activity,
not necessarily involving a commercial transaction. The app is named as such because we were
too caught up in the social buying/deal fervor!
